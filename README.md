# Cortex AI - Intelligent Energy Management Assistant

Cortex AI is an AI-powered chatbot built for industrial Energy Management Systems (EMS). It combines real-time telemetry, historical energy data, and multimodal AI capabilities to help users understand energy consumption, analyze electrical parameters, and interpret uploaded graphs using natural language.

The system is designed to simplify complex electrical concepts for non-technical users while also providing detailed insights for engineers.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction

Users can:

- Ask questions about energy usage
- Upload graphs for analysis
- Learn electrical concepts
- Request recommendations for improving efficiency

---

### 2. Data Processing

The backend:

- Reads telemetry data from Excel
- Extracts relevant measurements
- Builds an intelligent prompt
- Optionally attaches uploaded images
- Sends the request to Google's Gemini model

---

### 3. AI Response

Gemini determines the user's intent and can:

- Analyze telemetry
- Explain technical concepts
- Interpret uploaded graphs
- Suggest energy-saving measures
- Generate structured reports

---

## Supported User Intents

### Energy Analysis

Examples

- Analyze today's power consumption
- Why is my power factor low?
- Compare voltage across phases

---

### Graph Analysis

Upload an image and ask:

- Analyze this graph
- Explain the trend
- What anomaly do you observe?

---

### Educational Questions

Examples

- What is power factor?
- Explain reactive power
- Difference between kW and kVA

---

### Recommendations

Examples

- How can I reduce energy consumption?
- How do I improve power factor?
- Suggest efficiency improvements

---

## Image Analysis

Cortex AI supports multimodal input.

Users can upload:

- Power consumption graphs
- Temperature charts
- CPU/RAM utilization graphs
- Energy dashboards
- Trend plots

The AI analyzes the uploaded graph independently and only uses telemetry data when it is relevant to the user's question.
